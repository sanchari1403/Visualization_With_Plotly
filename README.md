# Visualization_With_Plotly

Python Plotly is an open source data visualization tool which enables us to understand and analyze data in a graphical way. Like the existing packages like Matplotlib, Seaborn, this tool also allows various types of line chart, bar plots, scatter plots etc.

I have tried accomplishing several charts and interactive plots using Plotly, some of which are shown in the notebook.

Tool: Jupyter Notebook
Language: Python
Dataset: In-built Iris and Tips dataset
Package: Plotly
